        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Determine the maturity of the sugarcane: The timing of the sugarcane harvest is critical, as it directly affects the yield and quality of the sugar. The sugarcane should be harvested when it is mature, which is typically between 9-12 months after planting, depending on the variety and growing conditions. The maturity of the sugarcane can be determined by checking the brix (sugar content) levels, which should be between 18-24%.

            Prepare the fields: Before harvesting, the fields should be cleared of any debris or plant material left over from the previous cycle. This ensures that the sugarcane can be easily accessed and harvested, and helps prevent the spread of pests and diseases.
            
            Harvest the sugarcane: The sugarcane can be harvested manually or with the help of machines such as harvesters or combine harvesters. During harvesting, the sugarcane is cut at the base, and the leaves and top portion are removed, leaving only the stalk. The stalks are then transported to the processing facility for further processing.
            
            Transport the sugarcane: Once the sugarcane has been harvested, it should be transported to the processing facility as quickly as possible to minimize deterioration and maintain its quality. The sugarcane can be transported by trucks, tractors, or other vehicles, depending on the distance and logistics.
            
            Process the sugarcane: Once the sugarcane reaches the processing facility, it is crushed to extract the juice. The juice is then filtered, heated, and evaporated to concentrate the sugar. The concentrated syrup is then further processed to extract the sugar crystals, which are dried and packaged for distribution.
            
            Clean the fields: After harvesting, the fields should be cleaned to remove any remaining plant material and debris. This helps prevent the spread of pests and diseases and prepares the field for the next crop cycle.
            
            Harvesting sugarcane is a critical step in the cultivation process, and should be done carefully and efficiently to ensure that the sugar is of high quality and yield. By following these steps during days 241-330, you will be able to harvest the sugarcane at the right time, transport it to the processing facility, and process it into high-quality sugar.</h3>
