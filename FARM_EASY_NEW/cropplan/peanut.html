It is recommended to store peanuts at a temperature of around 60°F (15°C) and a relative humidity of less than 60%. If stored properly, peanuts can last up to six months.

In summary, Days 76-90 involve further processing of the harvested peanuts by drying them for 1-2 weeks in a warm, dry place. Once the peanuts are fully dried, they can be removed from the plants and stored in a cool, dry place in airtight containers. Proper storage of peanuts is essential to prevent spoilage and ensure they can be used for longer periods.
