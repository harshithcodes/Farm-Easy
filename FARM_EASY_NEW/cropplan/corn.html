        <img src="https://www.cpm-magazine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/04/432013-6792.jpg">
        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">
            Choose a location with full sun and well-draining soil for planting corn. Clear the area of any weeds, rocks, or debris. Use a tiller or a garden fork to loosen the soil to a depth of 30 cm (12 inches). If the soil is poor, add organic matter such as compost or well-rotted manure to improve the soil's texture and fertility.
            
            After preparing the soil, you can also perform a soil test to determine its pH level and nutrient content. This will help you to choose the right type and amount of fertilizer for your corn plants. Based on the soil test results, you may need to add lime to raise the pH or add specific nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium to ensure a good crop.
            
            Once you have prepared the soil and performed a soil test (if necessary), you can move on to planting the corn seeds.</h3>

		<img src="https://gardenerspath.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Sowing-Sweet-Corn-Seeds.jpg">
        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Day 3-4:
            Create rows by making a furrow (shallow trench) in the soil. The rows should be spaced about 75 cm (30 inches) apart. Plant the corn seeds in the furrow, spacing them about 20-30 cm (8-12 inches) apart. Cover the seeds with soil and water gently.
            
            When planting corn, it is important to plant several rows instead of just one, as this will increase pollination and improve the quality of the corn crop. Plant each seed about 2-3 cm (1 inch) deep in the soil, making sure the pointed end of the seed faces downward.
            
            It is also important to water the newly planted corn seeds gently but thoroughly, making sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged. If the weather is dry, you may need to water the seeds more frequently to ensure they germinate properly.
            
            Once the seeds have germinated and the seedlings have emerged from the soil, you can move on to thinning them out and providing them with additional nutrients.</h3>

		<img src="https://cdn.wikifarmer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/corn-soil-praparation.jpg">
        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Day 5-7:
            Keep the soil moist by watering the newly planted corn regularly. Check for any signs of pests or diseases and take appropriate action if needed. If birds are a problem, you can cover the rows with netting or fabric until the corn has germinated.
            
            After a few days of planting the corn, you should see the seedlings emerge from the soil. At this stage, it is important to keep the soil moist by watering the corn regularly. Check the soil frequently and water when the top inch of soil feels dry.
            
            You should also inspect the corn plants for any signs of pests or diseases. Common pests that attack corn include cutworms, corn earworms, and rootworms. If you notice any signs of pests, such as chewed leaves or stalks, you can take appropriate action, such as using insecticidal sprays or traps.
            
            In addition, birds may be attracted to the newly planted corn seeds. If birds are a problem in your area, you can cover the rows with netting or fabric until the corn has germinated. This will help to protect the seeds from birds and other animals.
            
            After the corn has germinated, you can move on to thinning out the seedlings and providing them with additional nutrients.</h3>

		<h2 class="fs-title">Day 8-14</h2>
		<h3 class="fs-subtitle">As the corn begins to grow, thin out the seedlings so that they are spaced about 30-45 cm (12-18 inches) apart.</h3>
		<img src="https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/OCR-L-HG-SISKIN-COL-0416-01.jpg?w=1024">
        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Day 8-14:
            Once the corn seedlings have reached a height of about 8-10 cm (3-4 inches), you can begin thinning them out. Leave only the strongest and healthiest seedlings, spacing them about 20-30 cm (8-12 inches) apart. Thinning out the seedlings will help to ensure that the remaining plants have enough space, nutrients, and water to grow.
            
            In addition to thinning out the seedlings, you should also provide them with additional nutrients. Corn is a heavy feeder, meaning it requires a lot of nutrients to grow properly. You can fertilize the corn plants with a balanced fertilizer such as 10-10-10 or 12-12-12. Apply the fertilizer according to the package instructions, being careful not to over-fertilize, as this can damage the plants.
            
            As the corn plants continue to grow, they will begin to develop tassels and silks. The tassels are the male flowers that produce pollen, while the silks are the female flowers that receive the pollen. The pollen is transferred from the tassels to the silks by wind or insects, a process known as pollination.
            
            To ensure a good crop of corn, it is important to provide the plants with plenty of water and nutrients during this stage. Water the plants deeply once or twice a week, depending on the weather conditions. If the weather is hot and dry, you may need to water more frequently to prevent the soil from drying out.</h3>

        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">
            <p>Day 15-30:
                At this stage, the corn plants should be well established and growing vigorously. Continue to water the plants deeply once or twice a week, depending on the weather conditions. If the weather is hot and dry, you may need to water more frequently to prevent the soil from drying out.
                
                You can also apply a side dressing of nitrogen fertilizer when the corn plants are about knee-high (about 60-90 cm or 24-36 inches tall). Use a nitrogen-rich fertilizer such as ammonium sulfate or urea, applying it in a band about 5 cm (2 inches) from the base of the plants.
                
                It is also important to monitor the corn plants for signs of pests and diseases. Common pests that attack corn at this stage include corn borers, armyworms, and Japanese beetles. If you notice any signs of pests or diseases, such as yellowing leaves or holes in the leaves, you can take appropriate action, such as using insecticidal sprays or fungicides.
                
                As the corn plants continue to grow, they will begin to produce ears of corn. Depending on the variety of corn you planted, this can take anywhere from 60 to 100 days from planting to harvest. You can tell when the corn is ready to be harvested by checking the kernels. They should be plump and milky, and the husks should be brown and dry.</p>

        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Day 31-60:
            At this stage, the corn plants should be fully grown and developing ears of corn. The ears of corn will be covered in green husks, which will gradually dry out as the corn matures. It is important to continue watering the plants deeply once or twice a week, depending on the weather conditions.
            
            As the ears of corn mature, you may want to provide some additional support to the plants to prevent them from falling over in the wind. This can be done by gently tying the plants to stakes or using a trellis system. Be careful not to damage the roots or stalks of the plants when providing support.
            
            You should also continue to monitor the corn plants for signs of pests and diseases. Common pests that attack corn at this stage include corn earworms, corn rootworms, and cutworms. If you notice any signs of pests or diseases, such as chewed leaves or damaged ears of corn, you can take appropriate action, such as using insecticidal sprays or fungicides.
            
            As the corn plants mature, you may also want to apply a foliar fertilizer to the leaves of the plants. This can help to improve the quality and yield of the crop. Use a balanced fertilizer such as 20-20-20 or 18-18-18, applying it according to the package instructions.
            
            Harvesting of corn can begin once the ears are fully matured. To harvest, gently pull back the husks to expose the kernels. If the kernels are plump and milky, the corn is ready to be picked. Twist the ear of corn off the plant, being careful not to damage the stalk. Enjoy the fresh corn, or store it in a cool, dry place for later use.</h3>

		<img src="https://crops.extension.iastate.edu/files/styles/large/public/icm/IMG_4187.JPG?itok=1zSeL6NQ">
        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Day 61-90:
            At this stage, most of the corn should have been harvested, and the remaining plants should be left to dry out for a few more weeks before harvesting. This is known as "field drying" and helps to reduce the moisture content of the corn, making it easier to store and use.
            
            During this time, it is important to continue monitoring the corn plants for signs of pests and diseases. If you notice any signs of pests or diseases, take appropriate action to prevent further damage to the remaining crop.
            
            Once the corn has fully dried out, it is ready to be harvested. You can do this by cutting the stalks at ground level and pulling the ears of corn off the plants. Alternatively, you can use a mechanical corn picker to harvest the crop more quickly and efficiently.
            
            After harvesting, you should store the corn in a cool, dry place with good ventilation. This will help to prevent mold and other fungal growth, which can damage the corn. You can also store the corn on the cob, or remove the kernels and store them in an airtight container for later use.
            
            Overall, corn cultivation is a rewarding and satisfying process. With proper care and attention, you can grow a bountiful crop of delicious corn that can be enjoyed fresh, canned, or frozen for later use.</h3>
