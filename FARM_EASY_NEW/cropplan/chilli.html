        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">On Day 2-7, Water the seeds once a day to keep the soil moist. Chilli seeds need consistent moisture to germinate, so it's important to keep the soil moist but not waterlogged.

            Look for the emergence of seedlings. Chilli seeds typically germinate within 7-14 days, so keep an eye out for the emergence of seedlings. Once the seedlings have emerged, you can reduce the frequency of watering to every 2-3 days.
            
            If you're growing the seedlings indoors, make sure they receive plenty of light. You can use artificial lights or place them near a sunny window.
            
            Avoid overwatering, which can lead to fungal diseases and root rot. Allow the soil to dry out slightly between waterings, but don't let it become bone dry.</h3>

		<h3 class="fs-subtitle">Day 8-14 of chilli cultivation is a critical time for your young seedlings, as they begin to establish themselves and grow.</h3>

        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">On Day 8-14, you'll be Water the seedlings once a day to keep the soil moist. Make sure the soil doesn't dry out completely, but also avoid overwatering, as this can lead to fungal diseases.
            Fertilize the seedlings once a week with a balanced or nitrogen-rich fertilizer. This will help provide the nutrients your seedlings need to grow strong and healthy. Follow the instructions on your fertilizer package for the correct amount to use. 
            Thin the seedlings to one plant per pot or 6-8 inches apart in the garden bed. If you planted multiple seeds in a pot or closely together in the garden bed, you'll need to thin them out to allow each plant enough space to grow. Carefully pull out the weaker seedlings, leaving only the strongest one in each spot.  
            Monitor the seedlings closely for signs of pests or disease. Aphids, spider mites, and other pests can attack young chilli plants, and fungal diseases can quickly spread in moist conditions. Check the plants daily for any signs of trouble, such as yellowing leaves, wilting, or discoloration, and take action immediately if you see anything suspicious.</h3>

        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Water the plants deeply every 2-3 days. Make sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged. Deep watering encourages deep root growth and helps the plants become more drought-resistant.

            Fertilize the plants once a week with a balanced or nitrogen-rich fertilizer. Follow the instructions on the package for the correct amount to use.
            
            Watch out for pests and diseases. Aphids, spider mites, and whiteflies can be a problem at this stage, so check the plants regularly for signs of infestation. Remove any affected leaves or use a gentle insecticidal soap to control the pests.
            
            Provide support for the plants. As they grow taller, they may need support to prevent them from falling over. Use stakes or cages to keep them upright.
            
            Pinch off the growing tips of the plants. Pinching off the tips will encourage branching and bushiness, which will lead to a higher yield of fruit.
            
            Monitor the plants for signs of nutrient deficiencies. If you notice yellowing leaves or stunted growth, your plants may be lacking in certain nutrients. Correct the problem by adjusting your fertilization routine or adding a nutrient supplement.</h3>

        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">
            <p>On Day 22-30, Water the plants deeply every 2-3 days. Make sure the soil is moist but not waterlogged. Keep a close eye on the plants during this time as they can become more susceptible to water stress and drought.

                Fertilize the plants once a week with a balanced fertilizer. You can also use a potassium-rich fertilizer at this stage to encourage fruit development.
                
                Watch out for pests and diseases. As the plants get larger, they can attract more pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and spider mites. Check the plants regularly for signs of infestation and treat them promptly with insecticidal soap or another appropriate treatment.
                
                Continue to provide support for the plants. As they get larger and heavier with fruit, they may require additional support. Use stakes, cages, or trellises to keep the plants upright.
                
                Harvest ripe chillies. Depending on the variety of chilli you're growing, you may start to see ripe fruit during this period. Harvest them as soon as they're ready to encourage further fruit development.
                
                Prune the plants. If your plants are getting too bushy or crowded, you may want to do some selective pruning to promote air circulation and reduce the risk of disease.
                
                Monitor the plants for signs of stress or nutrient deficiencies. As the plants get closer to maturity, they may require additional nutrients or water. Keep a close eye on them and make adjustments as necessary.</p>

        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Day 31-40: Early Vegetative Stage
            During this stage, the chilli plants will continue to grow and develop their root systems. The plants will begin to produce more leaves, and the stems will continue to thicken. The farmer should ensure that the plants receive adequate water and nutrients to promote healthy growth.
            
            Day 41-50: Vegetative Stage
            During this stage, the chilli plants will continue to grow taller and produce more leaves. The stems and branches will become stronger, and the plants will begin to produce flowers. The farmer should continue to provide the plants with adequate water and nutrients and should also monitor the plants for pests and diseases.
            
            Day 51-60: Flowering Stage
            During this stage, the chilli plants will start to produce flowers. The flowers will eventually develop into fruits (chillies). The farmer should ensure that the plants receive adequate water and nutrients during this stage and should also monitor the plants for pests and diseases that can affect the fruit yield and quality. The farmer should also ensure that the plants receive sufficient sunlight to promote healthy growth and fruit development.
            
            It is important to note that chilli plants require regular pruning during the vegetative stage to promote healthy growth and fruit development. The farmer should remove any damaged or diseased leaves or branches and should also remove any flowers that appear before the plant is strong enough to support fruit development.
            
            Overall, days 31-60 of chilli cultivation are crucial for the final yield and quality of the chilli crop. The farmer should ensure that the plants receive adequate water and nutrients, and should also monitor the plants for pests and diseases to promote healthy growth and fruit development.</h3>
