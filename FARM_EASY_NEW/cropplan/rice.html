        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Water management: Rice requires plenty of water to grow, but it's important to manage water carefully to avoid overwatering or underwatering. The field should be flooded with about 5-10 cm of water, and the water level should be maintained throughout the growing season, with occasional drainage to prevent waterlogging. In some regions, rice is grown in alternate wetting and drying (AWD) conditions to save water.

            Weed control: Weeds can compete with rice plants for nutrients, water, and sunlight, so it's essential to control weeds throughout the growing season. This can be done manually, mechanically, or chemically, depending on the scale of the farm and the available resources.
            
            Fertilizer application: Rice plants require regular fertilization throughout the growing season to ensure that they have the nutrients they need to grow and produce a healthy crop. The amount and timing of fertilizer application depend on the soil fertility and the growth stage of the plants.
            
            Pest and disease management: Rice plants are susceptible to a variety of pests and diseases, which can affect yield and quality. Pest and disease management can involve the use of cultural practices, biological controls, or pesticides, depending on the severity of the problem and the desired level of control.
            
            Harvesting: Rice is typically harvested when the grains have reached maturity and have turned golden brown. The timing of the harvest depends on the rice variety, climate, and other factors. The rice plants are cut and threshed to separate the grains from the straw.
            
            By completing these steps, you will be able to manage the rice crop effectively and produce a healthy and productive harvest. Careful management of water, weeds, pests, and diseases is critical to ensure that the rice plants have the nutrients and conditions they need to thrive.

		<h3 class="fs-subtitle">Check the maturity of the rice by examining the color of the grains.
            Harvest the rice by cutting the plants at the base and bundling them together.
            Dry the rice in the sun for 2-3 days.
            Thresh the rice to remove the grains from the straw and winnow the grains to remove the chaff.</h3>
		<img src="image.png">
        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">
            Drying: After harvesting, the rice grains contain a high level of moisture and need to be dried to prevent spoilage. The rice can be dried naturally by spreading it out on a clean, dry surface in the sun or mechanically using a dryer. The moisture content of the rice should be reduced to around 12-14% before storage.

            Threshing: After drying, the rice grains need to be threshed to remove the husk. This can be done manually or mechanically, depending on the scale of the farm and the available resources. The threshed grains are known as rough rice.
            
            Cleaning and grading: The rough rice contains impurities such as dust, chaff, and broken grains that need to be removed. This can be done using sieves, air blowers, or other mechanical devices. The cleaned rice is then graded based on size, shape, and quality.
            
            Milling: The rice grains are polished by removing the outer layer of bran, resulting in white rice. The milling process can be done using traditional methods or modern machinery, depending on the desired level of quality and efficiency.
            
            Packaging and storage: The milled rice is then packaged in bags or containers and stored in a cool, dry place to maintain quality and prevent insect infestation.
            
            By completing these steps, you will be able to process the rice grains after harvesting and produce high-quality rice for consumption or sale. Drying the rice grains is critical to prevent spoilage and ensure a long shelf life. Threshing, cleaning, and grading remove impurities and result in high-quality rough rice. Milling and polishing further refine the rice and produce white rice suitable for consumption. Finally, proper packaging and storage help maintain quality and prevent spoilage.
