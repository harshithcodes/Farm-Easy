        <h3 class="fs-subtitle">Day 1 is all about selecting a suitable location for your carrot garden in the Indian region. It's important to choose a spot that receives full sun for at least 6 hours a day, as carrots require plenty of light to grow. Make sure the location has well-draining soil that is rich in organic matter. This can be achieved by using compost or well-rotted manure to improve the soil's fertility.

            It's also important to consider the soil pH when selecting a location. Carrots grow best in soil with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. You can test the soil pH using a soil testing kit, which can be purchased at a gardening or hardware store.
            
            Finally, consider the size of the location you choose. Make sure it's large enough to accommodate the number of carrot plants you plan to grow, and that there's enough space between plants to allow them to grow to their full size.
            
            By carefully selecting a suitable location for your carrot garden on Day 1, you'll set the foundation for a successful growing season!</h3>
